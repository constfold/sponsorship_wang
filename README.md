# How Much Wang Zhi An's apology make?

**Update:**

As Wang made his income public in a recent(2024-02-05) video, we could see that the income from Super Thanks is **8,602,198 JPY** (which is ~**414,608 CNY** / **57,871.519 USD**).

In our prediction, it should be `70% * 686,353 = 480,447` CNY / `70% * 96,053 = 67,237` USD. The error is ~17%, which is a little bit too much and may be caused by Google's using a different exchange rate than our.

There has been much speculation about the income generated by Wang's apology video, but nobody gives the exact number. So, I decided to investigate it myself. The result, as many expected, is quite substantial.

The number of comment(without replies) is **31701**.

The number of paid comment(aka. sponsored) is **4034**.

The total amount is about **686,353** CNY / **96,053** USD.

The sponsorship in detail:
